        It is important to understand that each attendee present needs to behave
        with a certain code of conduct that includes basic courtesy which
        involves respect for co-attendees, for speakers, for the organizing team
        and other members of the bio-community, for their data and for the
        objectives of the conference. Failure to do so will result in immediate
        disbarment of the member/ participant who violates the ethical code of
        conduct.
      </p>
      <h3>Privacy:</h3>
      <p>
        If any attendee is found recording any part of the event without prior
        consent/permission of the organizing team, there maybe a sequence of
        legal actions that may be taken against the attendee. Recording of any
        part of the event is strictly prohibited and failure to follow this rule
        will result in heavy consequences.
